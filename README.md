# Summer_AI_Work

This is a copy of my intro to AI course work.

This class was based off the book Neural Networks from Scratch in Python (NNFS)

The chapter 19 project does not come from the book and instead is based off of the Wisconson brest cancer AI detection that is a simple example online.
This example uses the Keras tool to simplify the devlopment of the AI model.
